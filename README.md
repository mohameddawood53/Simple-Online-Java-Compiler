1- you must change the path variable to the version of jdk in your pc before use it 

2- copy this path and enter the file - java.php - and change the paramter of the function - putenv() - with the new path

3- don't be stupid running these files in your local pc without setting up the XAMPP ( or any programe that have the same functionality )

4- don't forget to enable the apache 

5- finally Go To Hell 😊
